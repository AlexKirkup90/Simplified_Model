This application generates a portfolio based on the **Momentum-Score (25% Cap)** strategy, which was the winning model from our rigorous backtesting process.

- **Strategy:** Ranks NASDAQ 100+ stocks by 6-month momentum and weights the top 10 based on their score, with a 25% cap on any single stock.
- **Result:** This approach aims to "let winners run" while maintaining a prudent level of diversification.
